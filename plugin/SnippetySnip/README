SnippetySnip is a vim tool for automatically inserting parts (snippets) of other files in a file. I wrote it to insert sourcecode examples from source files into html blog-posts, but it can be used for all sorts of text files.

In the source file, you mark up a region of text (a snippet) and give it a name. In the target file, you mark where you want this particular snippet inserted. 

For instance:

source.py:
    (...)
    #snippetysnip_begin:foo
    def foo():
        return 0
    #snippetysnip_end
    (...)

target.html:
    <p><code>
    <!-- snippetysnip:/path/to/source.py:foo -->
    </code></p>

When SnippetySnip is run, the function foo() from source.py is inserted into the html file, which then looks like this:

target.html:
    <p><code>
    <!-- snippetysnip:/path/to/source.py:foo -->
    def foo():
        return 0
    <!-- snippetysnip_end:/path/to/source.py:foo -->
    </code></p>


SnippetySnip does not care about the format of the comments in your particular language, it only looks for the snippetysnip-strings.

You can have many snippets in a source file, and a target file can reference multiple snippets from multiple sources.

Paths can be relative or absolute.


HOW TO USE
In the source files, surround each snippet with snippetysnip_begin:SNIPPET_NAME and snippetysnip_end. These tags need to be on separate lines, but except from that, they can be inside the comment style of your choice, depending on the host lanugage. See the example above.
In the target file, put on a separate line snippetysnipp:FILE_NAME:SNIPPET_NAME
Paths can be relative or absolute. See the example above, or python/SnippetySnip/integration_tests/ for a more extensive one.
